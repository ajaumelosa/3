# Introduction

* Spanish voiced obstruents /b d g/ are traditionally described as having each two allophones: **stop** and **approximant**.

* The same allophonic distribution has been found in Peninsular and Latin American Spanish.

* However, certain Central American and Highland Colombian varieties show a preference for stop realizations in all context (except for intervocalic position).

* Although it is possible to make a binary distinction between tokens of /b d g/ with and without full occlusion, among the latter, one finds a considerable amunt of variation in the degree of constriction:

  + We have a continuum of realizations of these phonemes regarding the degree of constriction.

* Factors found to influence the degree of constriction: **height of the preceding vowel**, **preceding segmental context**, and **lexical stress**.

# Present study

* Most previous acoustic studies of Spanish spirantization focus on Peninsular Spanish.

<br>

* There are no previous acoustic studies of spirantization in Costa Rican Spanish or in other Central American or Highland Colombian Spanish.

<br>

* **GOAL**: to determine wheter Costa Rican Spanish significantly differs from other dialects in its allophony of /b d g/ when a continuous acoustic measure of spirantization is adopted.

# Methods

*Participants*:
  
  * 10 speakers of Costa Rican Spanish (5 men and 5 women).
  
    + From San José metropolitan area.
    
    + Ages: 26 - 47.
    
    + All speakers had postsecondary education.
  
  * 3 speakers of Madrid Spanish (2 men and 1 women).
  
    + **Question**: why did the authors use Madrid Spanish as a point of comparison?
    
    + **Question**: how do the authors justify the small sample?
    
    + Graduate students at UIUC.
    
    + They had been living in the US for about 2 or 3 years.

# Methods

*Data collection tasks*

  + **First task**: sociolinguistic interview (to elicit spontaneous speech).
    
  + **Second task**: picture-naming task (adaptation):

    + Participants were shown a picture with its corresponding word and were asked to formulate three complete sentences. The word had to be at the beginning of the sentence.
     
    + **Question**: why did the authors use this task?
      
  + **Third task**: reading of a pseudorandomized list of meaningful sentences three separate times. Same words from task 2.
    
    + **Question**: why did the authors use this task?
      
  + **Fourth task**: reading of a pseudorandomized list of words three separate times. Same words from task 2 and 3.
    
    + **Question**: why did the authors use this task?

# Methods

*Materials*

  * Target words were balanced for:
  
    + Place of articulation of the target consonant (/b d g/).
    
    + Position in word (word-initial vs. word-medial).
    
    + Stress position (at the onset of stress vs. unstressed syllable).
    
    + Preceding segment (vowel /a/, glide /j/, liquids /r/, /l/, fricative /s/).
    
  * Data from task 1 were discarded from further analyses because it did not yield balanced data sets.
  
  * Only data from tasks 2, 3, and 4 were used for the analysis.
  
  * Tokens per speaker: 540. Total of tokens: 7020.

# Methods

*Acoustic and statistical analyses*

  * For each target segment, two marks were placed:
  
    + One at the point of minimum intensity within the consonant /b/, /d/, or /g/.
    + Another one at the point of maximmum intensity during rhe following vowel.
    
    + The mean was subtracted.

  * Measure: **intensity ratio** (dividing values in dB at the two points marked)
  
  * A ratio closer to "1" indicates a more open vowel-like consonant production; and a ratio closer to "0" indicates a more stope-like realization.
  
  * Ratio values were arcsine-transformed and the effects of several fixed and random factors were tested with a series of linear mix-effects models further submitted to ANOVA summaries.

# Results

*Madrid Spanish*

  * The model yield significant effects of **place of articulation**, **stress**, **preceding segment**, and **task**.
  
  * Place of articulation significantly interacted with preceding segment.
  
    + **/b/**: /a-/ > /j-/ > /r-l-/ > /s-/.
    
    + **/d/**: /a-/ > /j-/ > /r-/ > /l-s-/.
    
    + **/g/**: /a-/ > /j-r-l-/ > /s-/.
  
  * /b/ is significantly more lenited than /g/, while /d/ did not differ from /b/.
  
  * Unstressed consonants are significantly more lenited than stressed ones.
  
  * Consonants in tasks 2 and 3 did not differ from each other, while consonants in task 4 were significantly more constricted than consonants in task 2.

# Results

*Madrid Spanish - Summary*:

  * There is no statistical difference between wor-initial (but phrase-medial) tokens of /b d g/ and vowel-medial tokens.
  
  * The degree of constriction of the target consonants depends on that of the preceding segment; the most open sounds are found after /a/, and the most constricted ones after /s/.
  
  * The intensity ratio is greater in stressed than in unstressed syllables.
  
  * Speakers produced more constricted consonants when reading words in isolation than when performing other tasks where words were placed in a meaningful context.

# Results

*Costa Rican Spanish*

  * The model yield significant effects of **place of articulation**, **stress**, **preceding segment**, **task**, and **word position**.
  
  * Place of articulation significantly interacted with preceding segment.
  
    + **/b/**: /a-/ > /j-r-l-/ > /s-/.
    
    + **/d/**: /a-/ > /l-r-j-/ > /s-/.
    
    + **/g/**: /a-/ > /r-l-/ > /j-s-/.
  
  * /b/ is significantly more lenited than /d and /g/.
  
  * Unstressed consonants are more lenited than stressed ones.
  
  * Word-medial consonants were more lenited than word-initial ones.
  
  * Consonants in task 3 triggered a slight but significant weakening in constriction degree, while task 4 triggered a significant fortition.

# Results

*Comparing the Two Dialects*

  * The sizes of the differences between /b/ and /d/ tokens preceded by /a/, and /b/ and /d/ tokens preceded by other segments is much larger in Costa Rican Spanish.
  
  * The magnitude of the difference between Costa Rican /b/ and /d/ tokens preceded by /a/ and all other tokens of these consonants is much greater than the difference between /g/ tokens preceded by /a/ and all other /g/ tokens in this dialect.
  
  * That the processes that trigger the differences in consonantal constriction as a function of the preceding segment are of a different nature in the two dialects.
  
      + The data are consistent with an interpretation according to which constriction of /b d g/ in the data from Madrid are affected by phonetic,
gradient processes while constriction of /b/ and /d/ (but not /g/) in Costa Rican Spanish are affected, in addition, by a phonologization of one of these gradient effects.

# Discussion and Conclusion

* In both dialects there is an effect of stress: tokens at the onset of a stressed syllable are more constricted than after the stress.

* In Costa Rican Spanish, target consonants were more lenited in word-medial than in word initial position. For Peninsular Spanish, no effect of word position was found.

* Postconsonantal position /g/ is weaker than /b/ and /d/ in Costa Rican Spanish.

* The way target consonants are affected by preceding segments is different:

  + In Peninsular Spanish: /s/ and /l/.
  
  + In Costa Rican Spanish: /s/.
  
* In Costa Rica, /b/ and /d/ have quite different targets after vowels and in all other contexts.
